If the variables you are streaming are assigned at too low rates, these buffers will take too long to fill up and the data will be either sent to python with a delay or not sent at all (if the buffer is never filled). For example, floats using dense timestamping are sent in buffers of 1024 values. If the float variable is assigned once every 12 milliseconds, filling a buffer will take 1024/(1/0.012) = 12.3 seconds. \n",
