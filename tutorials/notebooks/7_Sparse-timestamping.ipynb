The data buffers we received from Bela in the Streamer and the Logger had this form: `{\"ref_timestamp\": 92381, \"data\":[0.34, 0.45, ...]}`. Each data point is registered in the buffer every time we assign a value to `pot1` and `pot2` in the Bela code. The `ref_timestamp` corresponds to the timestamp of the first sample in the `data` array, in this case `0.34`. Since in the Bela code, we assign `pot1` and `pot2` at every audio frame, we can infer the timestamps of each value in the data array by incrementing `ref_timestamp` by 1 for each sample. \n","\n","This is an efficient way of storing data since instead of storing the timestamp of every item in the data array, we only store the timestamp of the first item. We call this *dense* timestamping. However, for many applications, we might not assign a value to a variable every frame, we might do it more than once per frame, once every few frames, or we might want to do it at irregular intervals. In these cases, we need to store the timestamp of every item in the data array. We call this *sparse* timestamping.\n","\n","In this tutorial we take a look at *sparse* timestamping.
