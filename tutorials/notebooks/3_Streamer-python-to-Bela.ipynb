    "# pybela Tutorial 3: Streamer – python to Bela\n",
    "This notebook is a tutorial for the Streamer class in the pybela python library. You can use the Streamer to stream data from Bela to python or viceversa. The complete documentation for the pybela library can be found in [https://belaplatform.github.io/pybela/](https://belaplatform.github.io/pybela/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be looking at sending data from python to Bela. There is only one method available in the Streamer class for this purpose: `send_buffer()`. This method sends a buffer of a certain type and size to Bela. \n",

    "This program expects two analog signals in channels 0 and 1, you can keep using the potentiometer setup from the previous tutorials (check the schematic in `1_Streamer-Bela-to-python.ipynb`)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will be sending the values of the two potentiometers from Bela to python. Once received in python, we will send them immediately back to Bela. The values received in Bela will be used to modulate the amplitude of two sine waves. It is admittedly an overly complicated way to modulate two sine waves in Bela, as you could of course use the potentiometer values directly, without having to send them to python and back. However, this example can serve as a template for more complex applications where you can process the data in python before sending it back to Bela. \n",

    "## Understanding the Bela code\n",
    "If you are not familiar with auxiliary tasks and circular buffers, we recommend you follow first [Lesson 11](https://youtu.be/xQBftd7WNY8?si=ns6ojYnfQ_GVtCQI) and [Lesson 17](https://youtu.be/2uyWn8P0CVg?si=Ymy-NN_HKS-Q3xL0) of the C++ Real-Time Audio Programming with Bela course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first take a look at the Bela code. The `setup()` function initializes the Bela program and some necessary variables. First, we set up the Watcher with the `Bela_getDefaultWatcherManager()` function. We then calculate the inverse of some useful variables (multiplying by the inverse is faster than dividing, so we precompute the inverse in `setup` and use it later in `render`). We then initialize the GUI buffers (these are the internal buffers Bela uses to receive the data) and the `circularBuffers`. The `circularBuffers` are used to store the parsed data from the GUI buffers, and are the variables we will use in `render` to access the data we have sent from python. We also set up the `binaryDataCallback` function, which will be called when Bela receives a buffer from python. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "bool setup(BelaContext* context, void* userData) {\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bela_getDefaultWatcherManager()->getGui().setup(context->projectName);\n",
    "    Bela_getDefaultWatcherManager()->setup(context->audioSampleRate); // set sample rate in watcher\n",
    "\n",
    "    gAudioFramesPerAnalogFrame = context->audioFrames / context->analogFrames;\n",
    "    gInvAudioFramesPerAnalogFrame = 1.0 / gAudioFramesPerAnalogFrame;\n",
    "    gInverseSampleRate = 1.0 / context->audioSampleRate;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // initialize the Gui buffers and circular buffers\n",
    "    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_OUTPUTS; ++i) {\n",
    "        Bela_getDefaultWatcherManager()->getGui().setBuffer('f', MAX_EXPECTED_BUFFER_SIZE);\n",
    "        circularBuffers[i].resize(circularBufferSize, 0.0f);\n",
    "        // the write index is given some \"advantage\" (prefillSize) so that the read pointer does not catch up the write pointer\n",
    "        circularBufferWriteIndex[i] = prefillSize % circularBufferSize;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bela_getDefaultWatcherManager()->getGui().setBinaryDataCallback(binaryDataCallback);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // vars and preparation for parsing the received buffer\n",
    "    receivedBufferHeaderSize = sizeof(receivedBuffer.bufferId) + sizeof(receivedBuffer.bufferType) + sizeof(receivedBuffer.bufferLen) + sizeof(receivedBuffer.empty);\n",
    "    totalReceivedCount = 0;\n",
    "    receivedBuffer.bufferData.reserve(MAX_EXPECTED_BUFFER_SIZE);\n",
    "\n",
    "    return true;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now take a look at the `render()` function. The render function is called once per audio block, so inside of it we iterate over the audio blocks. Since the potentiometers are analog signals, and in Bela the analog inputs are typically sampled at a lower rate than the audio, we read the potentiometers once every 2 audio frames (in the code, `gAudioFramesPerAnalogFrame` is equal to 2 if you are using the default 8 audio channels). Since the variables `pot1` and `pot2` are in the Watcher, these will be streamed to python if we run `start_streaming()` in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we check if the variable `totalReceivedCount` is greater than 0, which means that we have received at least a buffer from python. If we have received buffers and the read pointer has not caught up with the write pointer, we advance the read pointer in the circular buffer. The reason why we check if we have received a buffer first, is because we don't want to advance the read pointer if we haven't received any data yet, as then the read pointer would catch up with the write pointer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we read the values from the circular buffer and use them to modulate the amplitude of two sine waves. We then write the output to the audio channels.\n",
